# Air-Cursor-project
The Air Cursor project uses Python libraries like Open CV, Mediapipe, pyautogui, etc.
In the Hand Cursor Project using Python, we leveraged the power of OpenCV, PyAutoGUI, and MediaPipe to create an innovative, air gesture-controlled cursor system. Utilizing OpenCV, we accurately tracked and recognized hand positions, seamlessly translating them into precise cursor actions. The project involved complex algorithms and robust implementation to ensure smooth and responsive cursor movements based on hand gestures. This hands-free interface provided a futuristic and intuitive way to interact with digital devices, enhancing user experience and demonstrating the potential of gesture-based controls in modern technology. The result was a dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly solution that showcased the capabilities of advanced computer vision and automation technologies.
